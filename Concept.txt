For this first project, I Chose Blackjack! When I was still in high school, my first project was to make a game using Java Development Kit 2009. I chose blackjack. It was a horribly unoptimized 1139 lines of code. After that, whenever I learned a new language, I'd make the game again to see my progress. When I saw it as an option for project one, I knew it was meant to be!

Planning Phase:

The overall logic of the game should go like this:

The game board should look something like this:

Pseudocode idea:
create card object
create deck
create player and dealer objects
create functions to handle all of the cards (shuffling, dealing, etc)
/********Gameplay below********/
check for blackjack
if none, then player can choose hit or stay
hit will deal a card and check if the player busts
if the player chooses stay, it will pass to dealer's turn
dealer hits until he gets 17
POSSIBLE: chips will be paid out
play again will let the player choose if they want continue or not
