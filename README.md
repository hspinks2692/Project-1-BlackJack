## Game Description - BlackJack
This is a game of BlackJack with you friend. Since you and your buddy are playing, there's no need to bet money... That'd be no fun and could ruin your friendship after all.
The main goal of the game is to get 21. Since people have... interesting ways of playing, you are allowed to hit at any point... until you pass 21. You can even hit ON 21.
The game will display the cards and automatically calculate the values associated with them. The game will also not let the player spam any buttons... don't want to accidently hit twice
Cards are dealt automatically on entering the page. The player is allowed to choose either hit or stay. Cards are added on top of the other cards but still allows you to see cards under the top most card
As a little bit of extra immersion, the dealer's cards are dealt upside down.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML is used to display the game board and CSS is used to place everything and style everything at start. Javascript does the rest of the work. It enables and disables buttons, makes the cards move onto the screen, makes the colors flash, as well as runs the entire game! Everything from making the deck, deealing cards, to displaying the winner, Javascript does it for this game!

## Fun Programming section

This function started out very small by just dealing 2 cards to each person. It was fun to see how many actions were taken just before the game starts.

## Difficult Programming section

THIS SMALL FUNCTION CAUSED SO MANY PROBLEMS!! The main issue I had with this was it was counting aces in BOTH players' hands for reducing hand totals. I had to find a way to isolate which player's aces we were counting.

## Future Plans
Gambling: You and your friend decided "what's the harm in a little friendly gambling" and both pull out $1000. You will be able to bet money and attempt to take all your current friend's money.
